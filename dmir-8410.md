## Part I: Data Acquisition and Loading 
1. Choose a subreddit of your choice. Preferably something of interest to you. 
1. Conceptualize a database design that can collect the data.
    * Make sure your items (posts) are unique and not duplicated!
    * Make sure you capture at least title, author, subreddit, tags, title link, and timestamp
    * Along with the metadata, capture all the text into one or more data field(s) suitable for information retrieval
    * Write triggers for auto updates of IR related fields
    * Add index (either GIN or GiST) for the IR related fields
    * Additionally, design a field to hold:
        * Sentiment
1. Implement the database in your PostgreSQL schema
1. Implement cells of Python Code that 
    * collect the latest posts from a subreddit of your choice (**should be text-dominant not image/video**), 
    * processes the messages to extract metadata, 
    * process the text for IR, and 
    * perform computational linguistics (i.e, extract sentiment scores), 
    * then insert the data into your database.
1. After you have loaded data from a subreddit, choose a few more subreddits and load those!

## Part II: Analytics 

1. Write some test queries following the text vectors from Module 7.
1. Produce **interesting visualizations** of the linguistic data.
    * Try to look for trends (within a subreddit) and variations of topics across subreddits
    * Some comparative plots across feeds
1. Write a summary of your findings!

 
 

# Part II: Analytics 

## Task 7: Write some test queries to validate the text vector(s) (see Module 7).


**If you haven't done in Part I:** 
To prepare your DB to be read, you will need to grant the dsa_ro_user schema access and select privileges on your table.

```SQL
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <your schema> TO dsa_ro_user;  -- NOTE: change to your schema
GRANT SELECT ON <your table> TO dsa_ro_user;
```


```python
!pip install --upgrade pip
```

        <td>solotravel</td>
        <td>109</td>
        <td>i (19m) am a college student from the us and i recently got back from my first solo trip! romania and my first solo trip shattered all of my expectations. although i didn&#x27;t feel nervous in the weeks leading up to the journey, i began to feel some anxiety about two days before departure. i worried that things might not go according to plan, that there wouldn&#x27;t be enough to do, that the weather might be bad, or that i would feel lonely. while i enjoy my time alone, the idea of being in an unfamiliar place without knowing anyone for an extended period was new and somewhat daunting (but also freeing) to me. however, the day before the trip, my worries eased, and i knew that the journey to the destination is usually the most stressful aspect and that once i arrived, the experience would be incredible. and incredible it was. i knew that romania was a beautiful place, but i didn‚Äôt expect it to be as beautiful as it was. maybe it was because of the freedom that i felt while solo traveling, but i thought it was one of the most beautiful places i have been‚Ä¶ this will be a lot of text so tl;dr i went to romania for spring break and it opened my eyes to the world of solo travel, the beauty of eastern europe, and it has made me reconsider what i want to do with my life.**background**growing up, my family instilled in me the value of saving money for experiences rather than material items. unlike many kids my age who received expensive gifts (cars, new iphones every year, video games etc.) for milestones like their 16th birthday or christmas, my family prioritized travel and promoted frugality (i have an android and a lot of hand-me-downs from my brother). we started by exploring different parts of the united states, but as i grew older, we begin to travel abroad. by the time i graduated from high school, i had visited 27 countries across europe and north america, as well as all 50 states in the us. this early exposure to travel ignited a passion within me that only grew stronger with time and over the past 2 years, i have had a dream to solo travel one day. when i learned that my spring break was a bit longer than expected and that it did not overlap my parents&#x27; break, i thought that this would be a perfect opportunity for my first solo trip. i started searching for flights to eastern europe in november and saw that there were cheap flights to the baltics and the balkans. i thought about flying to helsinki because flights were less than $500, but there is a reason flights were so cheap-- the weather. i disregarded that option and looked further into romania. it is a country, along with other balkan countries, that has been on my radar for a while but one that i did not know too much about. the more i learned about romania, the more i wanted to visit. the carpathian mountains and beautiful castles (as well as cheap prices) had me sold. it was similar enough to other european countries that i have been to where i felt like it would be familiar and i&#x27;d be able to have a good first solo trip, but different enough that i expected to feel a big culture shock. after a bit of convincing of my parents, i bought my plane tickets in january for $647 and began planning the adventure of my life.**dates**arrived at midnight on march 24 and departed on april 1.**cities**bucharest - 1 night, brasov - 4 nights with a day trip to sinaia and rasnov, sighisoara - 2 nights, and bucharest - 2 nights. i was most interested in spending time in the mountains so i had my sights on the transylvania region. and although i had initially hoped to visit sibiu as well, i realized that trying to fit too much into my fairly short trip would only leave me feeling rushed and exhausted.**budget**i wanted to keep costs fairly low. my initial goal was to spend less than $1000, but after booking my accommodations, train tickets, and leaving room for food and activities, the final amount spend was a little over $1200. i cooked or prepared almost all of my meals from groceries that i bought ($15 at lidl went a very long way) as a way to save money, eat healthier, and save the stress of figuring out where to eat.**accommodations**i stayed at studio apartments through airbnb and an airport hotel. the airbnb in bucharest were a bit more expensive ($45/night), but brasov and sighisoara were both about $30 / night for fairly modern studio apartments with everything i needed. i splurged on the airport hotel ($80) because i had an early departing flight and i wanted to be able to walk to the airport. i considered staying at hostels, but for my first solo trip, i wanted to have my own space and privacy. additionally, i would only save a little bit of money by staying at a hostel and i would have to sacrifice a lot of comfort, privacy, and a kitchen to myself. for these reasons, i felt it was worth it to pay a little bit more for an airbnb.**activities**lots of hiking and aimless wandering, visiting castles, watching people go about their day, getting a haircut, and admiring architecture. i spent $16.47 on 3 activities: brasov art museum ($0.44), peles castle ($2.76), and the cable car up the mountain in sinaia ($13.27). other than those three things, everything that i did was free. (the haircut was $10, plus i tipped $5 because the barber was extremely kind and did an amazing job.)**what went right?**one of the things i was most worried about was the threat of rain. i really lucked out with the weather. during the week leading up to my trip, the forecast called for rain nearly everyday of the trip with probabilities over 70% each day. it snowed the day that i was in transit to sighisoara and sprinkled one day in brasov, but other than that i could not have asked for better weather for late march. the mountains were snow capped, but i was still able to hike to 5500 feet of elevation until i felt like the snow, ice, and wind were a bit too challenging and dangerous to keep going. navigating the train system turned out to be easy. i purchased my tickets online and did not need to print or collect my ticket at the station. the train attendants were able to scan my ticket on my phone with no issues. there was plenty to do and see. even when i felt like i had spent too much time in bra»ôov and sighi»ôoara, i could always just go for a mindless wander and discover things that i had not seen or done yet. for example, i spent two nights in sighi»ôoara and arrived early in the afternoon. this allowed me to spend nearly two full days in the town when i could have very easily gotten by with just one night or even an afternoon. however, having the extra day allowed me to go for a beautiful hike up a bluff opposite the citadel. i also spent 4 nights in brasov when 3 would have been just fine, but having the extra day allowed me to get a romanian haircut and go to rasnov. it also put less pressure on me and gave me time to slow down, relax, and reflect. i discovered solo traveling to be extremely liberating, rewarding, and enjoyable. the first couple days took some getting used to and i felt self-conscious about being alone, but then it felt normal. getting to call all the shots and choose when, where, and how i wanted to do something or go somewhere was very nice. i got to get up as early as i wanted and leave my airbnbs without waiting for anyone. one thing i noticed was that for better or worse, i felt like i was much more aware of my surroundings because i always get my head up and eyes peeled for any sketchy circumstances that may arise. fast wifi. i was surprised to find out that wifi in romania is insanely fast. my wifi speeds were 300, 510, 50, and 200 mb per second in bucharest, brasov, sighi»ôoara, and bucharest, respectively. this is faster than anywhere i have been in the us. similarly, buying a sim card. i never knew that buying a sim card would be so easy and cheap. i should have started buying sim cards on trips much sooner. for less than $7, i had virtually unlimited high speed data which came in handy when ordering ubers, using maps, looking up things to do on the fly, and using a hotspot on the train to do homework and watch youtube.**what went wrong?**almost nothing. the two biggest things was that my airbnb host canceled my reservation within 12 hours of me checking in and the internet at the bucharest airport being spotty and unusable forcing me to take a taxi into bucharest at 1 am instead of an uber. an uber would have been better because the taxi driver spoke little to no english, the taxi was a bit more expensive, and the taxi was very hard and stressful to find (using the kiosk which gives an agreed upon rate). this did not go wrong, but it was a mistake to take the train from bra»ôov to sighi»ôoara. initially, i planned to take a minibus, but because of snow and ice on the road, and because of the uncertainty whether the bus would even be running, i decided to take a train. the train i took was the ‚Äúexpress‚Äù train and took over 3 hours to go about 120 km (\~40km/hour or \~25 mph). it was a beautiful ride, but so slow that it drove me insane before i finally just accepted that it wasn‚Äôt going to be fast and just embraced it. this made me dread the 6 hour ride from sighisoara to bucharest, but i had already paid $15 for my ticket so i didn‚Äôt want to give that up and the train from brasov to bucharest is pretty fast. the positive was that the trains always ran on time and were dependable to get me there‚Ä¶ even if i could have almost biked faster. and the trains were full of character and full of characters. lastly, a week or two after purchasing my plane tickets, i learned that the transfƒÉgƒÉrƒÉ»ôan highway was closed for the season. this was disappointing, but it gives me more of a reason to come back.**what would i have done differently?**initially, i planned to spend a couple days in sibiu, but i felt like i was moving around too much. i think i could have pulled it off if i spent one fewer day in brasov and skipped the final day in bucharest by going straight to my airport hotel. part of me wishes i had done this, but after the long train ride, i think it is good that i didn‚Äôt. again, it just gives me more of a reason to come back. obviously, now i would have taken the bus instead of the train in the places where it is slow. however, i also would have taken the bus from the airport into bucharest. it runs 24 hours a day and is super easy to buy a ticket on board by using contactless pay. it would have saved me from being ripped off by the airport atm to withdraw cash to pay for the taxi. i think renting a car in brasov would have been very nice. getting into the more remote countryside and mountainous regions of romania would have been a lot of fun. from what i observed while riding the public transport and ubers, the drivers are crazy everywhere in romania, but more specifically in bucharest. the drivers in brasov were much less aggressive it seemed (but still crazy by american standards). my uber drivers in brasov actually wore their seat belts, unlike my taxi driver in bucharest who said, ‚Äúin romania, no seat belt, no problem!‚Äù as he drove 60-70 mph in a 45 mph zone. **safety**there was never a point within romania where i felt unsafe. the only time i felt unsafe was during my long layover in london even though i am pretty familiar with london. the crowds in london, especially on westminster bridge are what made me feel unsafe. most of the people in romania that i encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. with the lack of tourists around, it seemed that most locals were very happy to tell me about romania or help. i just need to remember that most people will at least be willing to point you in the right direction if you ask. i didn‚Äôt talk to as many people as i would have liked, it is scary to go out of your way to talk to strangers, but when i did, they were very nice and welcoming. and i am proud that i pushed myself out of my comfort zone to talk to at least a few people. **final verdict**would i go to romania again?absolutely yes. romania is a huge country and i only got to see a small sliver of it. a few cities that i want to visit: sibiu, ia»ôi (and go to moldova), cluj napoca, oradea, arad, and timi»ôoara. if i went back by myself, i would fly into budapest, hungary and travel to the last 4 cities mentioned above.what were the worst parts of solo travel?* not having the bank of mom and dad paying for everything was a wakeup to the reality of how travel can get expensive and snowball if you aren&#x27;t careful. luckily, i was able to stay close to the budget that i set out for myself.* there were many things that i saw that were really funny (ie. funny signs, names of places, people, etc.) and i wish i had someone to share those laughs with. the more chill days where i didn‚Äôt have much planned and didn‚Äôt know what to do (last day in brasov, afternoon of the full day in sighisoara, day before flying out in bucharest) were when it would have been nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of and figure out what to do.* the worst part was being responsible for all of my stuff. apparently, you shouldn‚Äôt leave your bag unattended in airports haha. in all seriousness, being responsible for all of my things all of the time made going to the bathroom at the airport or on the train a real chore. i would also check to make sure i still had my passport multiple times per day because i was terrified of losing it. that got annoying and stressful real fast.would i solo travel again?yes yes yes!!!! i loved the experience of solo traveling and have caught the solo travel bug. that‚Äôs not to say i don‚Äôt want to travel with other people because i would love to travel with family and friends, but now i have been exposed to the joys of solo travel.it was an amazing trip. now, it is time to start planning the next adventure.

        <td>please share this post with anyone who still cannot smell after getting covid as this post will help them bring their smelling senses back and keep them sane.  i caught covid 3 years ago and could not taste or smell anything. ofcourse like anyone else i thought it would go back to normal after a few weeks but in my case only my taste returned, i still couldn&#x27;t smell. this had me stressed, depressed &amp; anxious for 3 years as i deeped how i will never have the luxury of smelling again in my life (atleast those were my thoughts). doctors told me theres nothing they can do about long covid and sent me home with nothing so i had lost all hope and accepted the fact that this was permanent.  few months ago i rang up my gp and told them that i can&#x27;t take it anymore, if they did not see me and give me any sort of medication or scans etc. i will have suicidal thoughts. they booked me in straight away &amp; i had been seen by a new doctor different from last time. this doctor told me that she&#x27;ll book me in for some sort of scan which had a long waitlist but in the mean time prescribed a nasal spray for me to try.  the nasal spray is called nasofan aqueous 50 microgram nasal spray (fluticasone propionate) &amp; it saved my sanity. after 1 month of use i started to see slight improvements, i informed my doctor and she told me i need to stay on this medication for a minimum of 4-6 months in order for my smelling to return to 100%. not everybody sees improvements right away so please stick to it and get refils constantly once you run out as this will really bring your smelling senses back!!!!my smelling is now perfect after 6 months of use &amp; i&#x27;m happier than ever. i even recommended it to a friend with the same issue, he too is seeing improvements but still has a few months to go.  p.s it helps with hayfever lowkey. update: the nasal spray is a steroid and it unblocks your sinuses around the eye/upper cheek area of your face. covid blocked my sinuses and that‚Äôs the reason i couldn‚Äôt smell, a lot of people have this same issue who can‚Äôt smell since covid. the way i tested the improvements was by eating an onion, when my sinuses were blocked i couldn‚Äôt smell or feel the stinging effect an onion would give you when you eat it raw. after a month of using the medication i could start to smell and feel the effects of an onion.</td>

        <td>all, i just came back from an incredible solo trip and i want to share my story to encourage others to solo travel - no excuses!last year i was working a demanding job at a startup in san francisco, but i loved the team and wanted to stick through it. when it became clear that it wasn&#x27;t the right fit anymore (i started getting stress rashes on my body, grinding my teeth in my sleep, etc.) i put in my notice, exactly one day before the major tech layoffs. i figured it would take me a while to find something new in the current job environment, so i made a decision matrix (it&#x27;s nerdy and highly effective) of my values and what next life step aligns the most. moving in with a host family in alaska and training their sled dogs came on top, so that&#x27;s what i did.it was an incredible experience, y&#x27;all. something completely new and unexpected. my host family is a well-known sprint dog musher family and i was welcomed into their mushing community from day 1. every morning and afternoon i would go outside and feed the dogs, clean their kennel, and generally give them love. every other day we took the dogs out to train, and i learned quickly how to harness dogs, hook them to the line, and water them when they got back (i stay behind in case of emergencies). and in my free time (there was a lot of this), i started reading more, progressed on my passion project, and took job interviews. i never thought scooping frozen poo could be so zen... 3 months later, i&#x27;m now back to sf. i feel more calm, more in control of my career narrative, am currently easing myself back into the hustle and bustle of city life. i was able to land a new job and started remotely in alaska, which was completely ok with my host family. some notes: \- i have no prior sled dog training experience, although i have fostered dogs in the past\- website where i found my host family: workaway.info --&gt; search for &quot;dog sledding&quot; --&gt; definitely read through the description and their reviews, host families vary a lot\- i specifically looked for a host family with wifi, so i could keep applying for jobs and take job interviews. they also specified the work is about 20hr/week, mostly on weekends, which allowed me to start my new job remotely while i was still there\- i have a mortgage with my partner, so finances and duration of stay were definitely a discussion item while planning this trip. staying with a host family means there&#x27;s no additional cost to room &amp; board, so my expenses stayed about the same in alaska (maybe even cheaper) than in sf. my partner also visited me over a long weekend in the middle of the workaway, which was a nice treat.that&#x27;s it! what i learned is solo travel doesn&#x27;t have to be a big life transition, you can certainly find opportunities to peek into another &quot;world&quot; for a few weeks or months, and you can do it under most life circumstances. happy to answer questions or bounce ideas about your trips :)</td>

        <td>i&#x27;m 36m from eastern europe. i lived in beijing and travelled to 60+ countries, so i&#x27;m not new to different cultures. most of my favourite countries are developing ones (like vietnam, uzbekistan, mexico, peru). i&#x27;m in india now and for the first time ever i&#x27;m thinking about cutting my trip short. this country is so inconvenient on so many levels.i&#x27;m not a budget traveler, but also not a &quot;resort&quot; kinda guy. it feels like in india you either go budget or luxury, but mid-range is completely missing. i usually walk a lot exploring the city, but it&#x27;s just so stressful here. dirt, dogs, cows, beggars, sellers, scammers everywhere. no sidewalks, you literally have to walk between cars and tuktuks. haggling with tuktuk drivers is a pain, uber drivers simply don&#x27;t show up, just try to collect the cancellation fee. don&#x27;t get me wrong, the sights are amazing, but when my visit comes to the end i get nervous that i have to go back to the streets.i usually go for mid-range hotels, but in here the quality is beyond shitty. i choose the ones with above 8 rating on booking.com and they look great in the picture. even more expensive hotels lack hot water and there&#x27;s always at least one stain on the sheet and the towel. intercity travel is also a struggle. i try to avoid domestic flights or solo taxis for environmental reasons, train tickets are sold out and all that is left is buses. there are no bus terminals and travel agencies don&#x27;t organize hotel pick-ups.i&#x27;m used to paying more as a foreigner. but the record holder might be the modern art museum of mumbai, where i paid 25 times what locals do. for a museum that doesn&#x27;t even have a permanent exhibition, basically just a gallery for a (bad) temporary exhibition.i always check the tipping policy before traveling to a country and happy to apply it. if i get a service worth tipping. that rarely happens in india. taxi drivers try to shame me into tipping after an extra stop at a tourist trap or not even reaching the destination. restaurant workers point out a dozen times that the service fee was not included. vendors keep following me and don&#x27;t understand the word no. the touching is the worst. i can&#x27;t stand when somebody touches me and tries to physically stop me so they can sell/beg/scam. i&#x27;m a calm person, but indians get the worst out of me.people in general act nice on the surface, but the communication and cultural gap is wider than i expected. i use cs to meet locals, usually just for a chat over a coffee, sharing travel stories and getting to know each other&#x27;s culture. well, in india it quickly turns into a charity case: how can i help them get &quot;a schengen visa&quot; or &quot;a job in the eu&quot; or they simply just push me to pick up the bill after their expensive order at the restaurant. i never had an indian cser before and i feel i won&#x27;t ever after this trip.am i getting old for solo traveling or do others have similar experiences in india? are there any hacks that help shut out the bad things?</td>

        <td>travelled shortish-term, a few weeks here and there, followed by a couple 1 month stints. always loved it. was living in london and doing a job i hated, and then packed up and went away for nearly a year. again, loved it.i&#x27;m 32, i&#x27;m back in the uk (not in london, but my home town), and i&#x27;m bored out my brains. it&#x27;s not just boredom. i realised that life in the west doesn&#x27;t resonate with me. i feel like an alien in my home country, where most people just go to work and do their regular job on generally low pay, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year, until when they retire (if they don&#x27;t die before then). and nobody seems to question this. they have the same conversations at work, sit in the same chair for however many years. they approach friday and you start to hear &#x27;nearly there now mate&#x27;. every year turns out the same here - in september it starts to get dark, and it gets progressively worse up until about march the next year. it gets dark at like 5pm or earlier i think. incredibly depressing. most people settle into a routine of work, drive home, pick the kids up from school, prepare dinner, put the television on, put the kids to sleep, go bed, rinse and repeat. at least in my hometown where life is at a slower pace than london, this is all they do. everyone settles down at like 25. my extended family question when i will settle down and sort of wonder why i don&#x27;t want to put some roots down. around them i feel like i&#x27;m weird.lifestyle when solotravelling vs homelife is different. making friends is hard at 32 as well, as per above, most people seem to settle at 25. you can&#x27;t get men out for a pint or anything easily at all. you literally have to get permission from their wife (not joking) and give plenty of advance notice. dating is awful where i am. i match with women who are like 39 and who have 2 kids from previous relationship(s). when i travel, i get attention from really attractive girls, who are around my age or even a few years younger. when i travel, i meet lots of fellow travellers and locals. i meet open minded people who are not bogged down by some stereotypical life.i have read before &#x27;wherever you are, there you are&#x27;, or something like that. but even if i had all those things in the uk, a social life, a girlfriend, i wouldn&#x27;t want to live that life of buying a house, getting a car, nice holidays, nice watch, nice this, nice that. because to chase those things, you have to repeat yout same day, day in day out, and really i value experiences and adventure over accumulating things.i went travelling during covid, and yet ironically i live a life as though i am still in a lockdown. all i do is go to the gym. i can&#x27;t seem to find the desire to re-integrate into the real world again if you like. i go to work and hear the same conversations, the same everything. it actually negatively affects my mental health. after last time living in london, it&#x27;s now much more expensive there, much more crime taking place and i really have no desire to grind away at some office job and work in a high stress position just to pay 60%+ of my take home pay on rent and bills. i am trying to upskill in coding which i hope to be able to consider one day as a remote option.i seemingly have these regular sunday blues, where i regularly reflect on these thoughts. my friends don&#x27;t understand where i am coming from as they are all caught up in the corporate grind and pursuing job promotions and so forth. i tried counselling and i didn&#x27;t like it, nor did i think it was worth ¬£45 for a 50 minute chat with someone. mixed in with the absolutely dire current negative media coverage surrounding politics, oil protestors, inflation etc, it&#x27;s just so dam dark and miserable. sadly, i have to be in the uk for the next 6-8 months or so before thinking about next steps.i just feel like an alien after my travels. almost as if had i never travelled i would be more content with the 9-5 lifestyle? does anyone else share this sense of isolation after these travels? this sense of failing to have the desire to slot back into &#x27;where they are supposed to be&#x27;? i so wish i could connect with other isolated folk who have had a similar experience to me. i can&#x27;t share who i really am with anyone in my every day-to-day existence. edit: came home and just did not expect so many replies. thanks for all the replies and private messages - i&#x27;m not sure i can get back to everyone though but we shall see.</td>

        <td>i need to get this off my chest.like the title says‚Ä¶ i‚Äôve wanted to travel since i was a child, just old enough to realize there was an entire world outside of my neighbourhood. as i‚Äôve gotten older, i‚Äôve talked about booking trips with friends and boyfriends and siblings‚Ä¶ but it never happened. it was always just a ‚Äúpipe dream‚Äù, or we were too broke, or the friendship/relationship ended before we could book anything, or it was always something we were gonna do ‚Äúnext year‚Äù. then, as i started to think about solo travelling more and more, i got excited at the idea of it but i always got caught up in the planning stage, trying to make everything perfect before i booked a trip. i was so scared to book a solo trip without having every little detail mapped out.finally, a few weeks ago, as i was browsing the web for cheap flights (just ‚Äúbecause‚Äù) i found one headed from here to europe at a decent price and i just said‚Ä¶ fuck it. and i bought the plane ticket. i didn‚Äôt wait for someone else to be ready to go with me, and i didn‚Äôt wait until i had everything perfectly planned to a tee. i just booked the flight and i‚Äôm figuring everything else out between now and the day i fly out.i‚Äôm feeling a lot of things. part of me is absolutely terrified ‚Äî i‚Äôm not necessarily in the best place in my life right now, and in hindsight it was a bit of a reckless choice to make financially (i have enough money for an emergency fund &amp; to get by, but it‚Äôs difficult to elaborate without a lengthy story time). i also don‚Äôt have a lot of travel experience so i‚Äôve been overloading my brain, trying to make sure i have the necessary safety precautions sorted out before i go (i.e, travel insurance, a secure place to carry my passport and other important docs, etc.) but at the same time, i feel so liberated. i feel like i‚Äôm finally taking control of my life. and i feel that if i didn‚Äôt do it now then i never would have, and i‚Äôm so excited to just do it.i‚Äôve let fear and anxiety hold me back from the life i want for too long. i‚Äôm still really young, in my early 20s, and i can‚Äôt imagine waiting another 20+ years before i finally choose to make a change. i‚Äôm scared and i have some moments where i doubt my decision and wonder if i was too impulsive, but i‚Äôd rather spend the next little while stressing to get all the information i need before i leave, than to spend another year of my life waiting and wishing for the ‚Äúright‚Äù time.(edited for typos and clarity)</td>

        <td>80</td>
        <td> hey guys!i am biking 2000 km across japan alone for the next few months and i&#x27;m going to be writing updates about my journey. i spent several days working my way from the city of kagoshima through the mountains to a small town on the coast called izumi.here are the [photos ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/1ejyechksxbaobs3njq8fkglqkfisvp95?usp=share_link&amp;pli=1)if anyone wants to see!i had a very interesting experience on my first day of biking across japan. i was biking through the mountains of kagoshima, the southernmost province of japan. when i got to my hotel i found out it was abandoned. i was afraid since i do not speak japanese and i could not find a new hotel nearby. it was getting very dark out and i kept biking through the mountains. i was very tired since i had biked uphill for 9 hours, and my body started to feel heavy. i met a man cooking chicken skewers in a small village and i asked him if i could camp on his property. he agreed and i ordered some hot chicken from him. as we talked through google translate i told him about my journey across japan and he invited me to stay with him in his home! we drank green tea deep into the night and he told me about his life and he showed me his kanata. i&#x27;m so grateful that he opened his heart and his home!the next morning i tried to bike the rest of kagoshima&#x27;s mountains, but i was only able to bike 30 kilometers in 11 hours. the mountains made it very hard, i had to get off my bike and push uphill for most of the trip. i have about 100 pounds of cargo with me. i had planned to stay at a camping ground, but it was getting dark and my stop was still far away. i found a patch of grass in a small town to set up my tent for the night. i went to the grocery store to buy some dinner and water. i asked the owner if i would get in trouble for sleeping in my tent in that spot without a permit. when she learned of my plan, she said that i could sleep in her grandmother&#x27;s empty home! i was taken aback. i&#x27;m a complete stranger and they let me stay in their home. i was about to cry at her kindness. the japanese people are the kindest people i have ever met. i was able to get a good night&#x27;s rest before attempting to escape the mountain in the morning.this became the most stressful day of my life. i continued my journey across the mountains of kagoshima. i used google maps to find a route to the town of izumi. the route took me deep into the mountains. as i got far in i realized that the route was abandoned. trees cover the path and i had to throw my equipment over time and time again. i kept going through as the map said i would find a road soon. i soon started to lose signal and my water started to run low. as i continued i reached the road and learned it was abandoned. i was afraid i would get lost if i turned back so i kept pushing forward. the road was covered in trees and rocks, many parts are covered in landslides. sunset quickly approached and i didn&#x27;t want to travel this dangerous road in the dark so i set up my tent and slept. i eventually reached a part of the road that had collapsed. i started to climb around very slowly, the ground kept breaking away under my feet. it was very scary as the smallest misstep would mean i would fall and get injured. there would be no one to help me. i wouldn&#x27;t even be able to call for help since my phone didn&#x27;t have a signal in such a remote area. i spent several hours climbing and taking my belongings back and forth. i had to be very careful. i eventually made it across. i received many injuries from the rough forest and the broken road. i fell many times. i eventually was able to make it out in the morning.i was completely out of water and i had many injuries from the experience. i continued to push forward and found a highway where i continued to bike to izumi. within a few minutes of riding, i found a rest area with a water fountain! i was very relieved. as i refilled my bottle a paramedic stopped there to use the restroom. i stopped him and asked if he had a first aid kit. he noticed my injuries and started to clean them with alcohol. he used his bandages to help wrap the wounds. i was very grateful. i tried to give him money many times but he refused to accept. i continued my ride to the town of izumi. i was very happy that the route was mainly downhill. i was very tired and it was to travel. i found the town of izumi where i was able to get some more medical attention and food. it was the first time i was able to eat in 32 hours. i found a hotel where i was able to take a hot bath and eat some yummy ramen! once again i am humbled by the kindness of japan. my apologies for the delay in posting this update and spelling mistakes, i am still exhausted.  i turned this experience into a video, but i&#x27;m not allowed to post it here sadly. if you&#x27;re interested in seeing it feel free to dm me. tldr:i biked across the mountains of southern japan, local families opened their homes to me on two different occasions and google maps almost killed me.</td>

        <td>TRIP REPORT: 3 Months in Europe - First Time Solo Traveller</td>
        <td>solotravel</td>
        <td>197</td>
        <td>**1. background:** just got back from a 3 month amazing trip to europe (13 countries / 22 locations) and wanted to share my experiences, things i&#x27;ve learned, and advice i feel would be helpful for anyone thinking about doing a similar trip. i graduated from university in 2021 but have been working in the industry (it) since 2017 so have been fortunate to earn and save alongside study. i have travelled before but only with family, i&#x27;d say i&#x27;m a pretty introverted person so deciding to solo travel was pretty nerve-wracking and an opportunity for me to become more social. i have been following this subreddit for a few years and have been thoroughly inspired by the countless posts and positivity shared amongst /r/solotravel so wanted to share my experiences with hopes it will inspire others. i chose europe as i wanted somewhere easy to navigate, with minimal language barriers, and was inspired by what i had seen looking at this subreddit and pics on /r/travel. &amp;nbsp;**about me:**- 24 y/o male from australia- first time in europe and first-time solo travelling, have travelled before but only with family (usa, india, thailand, nz)- was very fortunate to be able to get time off work (without pay). big reason for this is as my boss is also an avid traveller so the empathetic feelings went a long way. - have been working alongside uni and have enough funds to cover my trip.&amp;nbsp;**trip summary:**- 85 days- 13 countries / 22 cities- hostels only- 10 flights / 25 trains- carry on only (osprey farpoint 40l) + (15l day pack)- hundreds of new people met, new connections all from over the world!- 30+ museums / art galleries visited- ate out for all meals (never cooked at the hostel)- üëÄ &gt;!3 hookups üò¨!&lt;&amp;nbsp;**cost:**- i had originally estimated i&#x27;d spend $12,000 for 3 months ($4,000 each for transport, food/drink, accommodation)- total spend ~ **$15,300 aud** (approx $9,500 usd)&amp;nbsp;**countries + cities / map (in order of visit)**- uk (london)- france (paris)- portugal (lisbon)- spain (madrid, barcelona)- france (nice)- italy (cinque terre, florence, rome, venice, milan)- switzerland (lucerne, interlaken, zermatt)- germany (munich)- austria (vienna)- hungary (budapest)- poland (krakow)- czech republic (prague)- germany (berlin)- netherlands (amsterdam)- belgium (brussels)- france (paris)&amp;nbsp;here&#x27;s a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/x2crv18) of my route.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**detailed summary**- **london, uk** (5 nights) * flight from sydney to london. stopover in singapore. * hostel: wombats, met some amazing people here and was lucky that they all seemed to stay for a similar duration as mine. easy to make friends, close to tower bridge and the tube, beds were creaky and last night had a dorm mate who snored like a chainsaw, other than that a solid hostel. 8.5/10. * pros: very similar to australia. coming from sydney direct to london felt like not much had changed other than the landscape. the buildings were much more beautiful and historical, however, the rest of the city and how it operated felt similar to sydney, the urban planning, shopping, transportation, and people all felt similar. differences i noticed were it was much more expensive, ac was a luxury, peopled walked extremely fast and couldn&#x27;t make up their mind whether or not to stay left or right, afternoons at the pub seemed like a societal norm, with white collar and blue-collar workers all mingled together which was nice to see. london also felt quite walkable, once you are in the city centre, most sights are able to covered with a few hours of walking. museum/history fans are spoilt in london, incredible museums and the majority are free.  * cons: expensive. the aud gets about 0.57 gbp for every dollar so the cost of living in london was eyewatering, a decent meal would run about 13 gbp, and a beer about 4 gbp. people in london also seemed a bit cold, not rude but just a tad reluctant to open up and have meaningful conversations.  * favourite memory: taking in the view from the sky garden at night with beers in hand. partying through the night till 6 am at e1. * overall: 8/10- **paris, france** (5 nights) * eurostar from london to paris. * hostel: the people - belleville. this was an okay hostel, the dorms were nice and they had a good location next to the metro, however it lacked a social vibe as it was just too big and open to the public (public bar). met some people in the dorms but the interactions were limited to just exchanging pleasantries/small talk, people seemed to be in groups or just anti-social, guess it comes down to luck. made friends with the bartenders and enjoyed some solo time in paris. when i was craving socialisation, i used the chat feature on the hostelworld app to meet people which was amazing. 7/10. * pros: lives up to the hype. i had some culture shock when i got off at gare du nord, hardly anyone was speaking english and it hit me that i was in an actual foreign country. was in love with the museums there, musee d&#x27;orsay is my favourite museum/art gallery in the world, i would recommend it over the louvre. also, recommend watching the 1 am eiffel tower lights as they sparkle while the main tower lights are switched off. incredible foodie city with restaurants and cafes serving lots of amazing food. i found paris expensive but not as bad as london. people were reluctant to speak english but when you put in some effort they help you without a second thought.  * cons: i didn&#x27;t experience much nightlife in paris, i did go to a few bars but felt they were quite posh with people dressing up and attracted more of an older crowd. perhaps i was just in the wrong areas. paris metro although efficient and cheap is always packed, i rarely got a seat here, minor detail but i guess something to point out. paris is also huge, wouldn&#x27;t consider it a walkable city unless you are a fan of walking a marathon every day. the metro also didn&#x27;t run after 1 am which for such a big city i found strange, would&#x27;ve enjoyed more nightlife if i had a safe/cheap option to return back to the hostel late at night. * favourite memory: seeing the eiffel tower for the first time, i teared up a bit not going to lie. visiting versailles was also incredible. * overall: 8.5/10- **lisbon, portugal** (4 nights) * flight from paris to lisbon * hostel: yes! lisbon hostel. a great social hostel right in the heart of lisbon. literally situated a street behind the town square, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better location. with cheap beers, a great common area, daily activities and friendly staff, this was an amazing hostel. met lots of people here and did plenty of activities together, the hostel also organised tours to sintra which was helpful if you wanted to go with familiar faces. the hostel also had bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms which i view as a pro which also made the experience nice. 9/10. * pros: lisbon truly had it all, amazing food, beautiful scenery, beaches, forests, mountains, nightlife, the list goes on. i never had a bad meal in lisbon, i remember looking at &#x27;food near me&#x27; on google, normally i&#x27;d sort by minimum 4.5 stars but literally every restaurant was 4.5 stars minimum. lisbon also had amazing nightlife, alcohol is cheap, beers were 1 euro each, a cocktail like a long island was 5 euros and they free pour them so you got to be careful. the architecture is also splendid, the tiled buildings and ornate walkways are charming, just be careful when it rains! the people were also super hospitable and extremely friendly, the majority also spoke english very well. lisbon also felt small enough to see everything but yet large enough that you always stumbled upon cool new spots, i found that really enjoyable when i was wandering around. * cons: extremely hilly, i remember when i&#x27;d put in a destination on google maps it would say 800m but it will take you 10 minutes to walk, prepare your knees for some torture while you&#x27;re here or save yourself the misery and take the cute trams around. a minor con is that i found lisbon extremely touristy, i believe a lot of east coast americans fly into lisbon as it is the closest to the states, nothing against americans (love you all) but just a minor thing to consider. sintra also felt like a bit of a scam, the weather there was always terrible with dense fog covering the castle, meaning you couldn&#x27;t see it unless right next to it. getting inside the castle also required a wait in queue of at least an hour even if you had pre-booked tickets. minor inconveniences but something to take into consideration.  * favourite memory: getting pizza and sitting under the bridge and watching sunset. getting too drunk on long island iced tea&#x27;s and being helped home by two of the nicest british people. if you are out there, i love you both! * overall: 9.5/10- **madrid, spain** (4 nights) * flight from lisbon to madrid * hostel: sungate one. one of the best hostels i&#x27;ve ever stayed at, the staff here were absolutely incredible and did everything, wanted to skip a bar crawl and watch a movie, someone would be there to give you company, wanted to go on a picnic, someone would be sure to join you. the people here did everything together, breakfast, eating out, walking tours, dinner, free tapas and sangria, and absolutely amazing hospitality by these guys. bonus points that they did not have bunk beds and the apartment complex in which the hostel was housed had the cutest dog living upstairs. 9.5/10. * pros: madrid like lisbon felt quite small in the sense you could see most attractions in a day but also large enough that you could stumble upon attractions you wouldn&#x27;t of normally seen. the madrid palace was incredible, personally, i found it better than versailles. the rooms were all differently ornated with different colours and styles, something which i felt versailles lacked. one thing i didn&#x27;t understand was why they didn&#x27;t allow us to take pictures inside (i managed to sneak a couple :p). madrid also was quite affordable, a three-course lunch could be had for 10-15 euros, beers were 1 euro, the metro was also affordable and safe. most people spoke english very well and the city felt quite young. amazing nightlife was also to be found in madrid, the nightlife district was closely situated to the hostel so everynight we were able to experience new bars/clubs which were popular with tourists, making the experience much better. i also found spanish people in general to be extremely welcoming, very warm and hospitable, and to add a point extremely good looking.  * cons: honestly, i can&#x27;t think of too many cons in madrid. perhaps the extremely hot climate during summer can be off-putting but other than that, madrid felt like it had it all.  * favourite memory: impromptu sunset picnics at the temple of debod, partying all night with locals at fucking mondays.  * overall: 9.8/10- **barcelona, spain** (5 nights). * train from madrid to barcelona * hostel: yeah! hostel. the hostel was pretty good, met some awesome people and had plenty of nightly activities planned. i found that it was a bit large so meeting people was doable but a bit more challenging. the location itself wasn&#x27;t that close meaning that for pup/club crawls you would have to catch the metro at night and usually a cab/walk back to the hostel. it also didn&#x27;t help that since barcelona streets all look the same, finding this hostel while drunk was a nightmare :p. 8.5/10. * pros: barcelona is known for its nightlife and it sure lives up to the hype. visited several clubs here and can say if you wan&#x27;t to party, barcelona will always have something for you every night of the week. i also found the food here incredible, tapas, sangrias and paella were all amazing and affordable, would definately return for the culinary experience here. the olympic pool was also a highlight of my time in barcelona, on a hot day it was amazing to relax there, bonus points that it didn&#x27;t seem touristy at all with lots of locals there enjoying. watching sunset over the city from the bunkers was also incredible, the tiring hike up there is definately worth it! lastly, the gaudi architecture was &#x27;unique&#x27;, personally not my taste but many people i spoke with found it amazing. the sagrada familia is like nothing else, insanely unique, same goes for park guell. the city had lots of his work scattered around so if you&#x27;re a fan of his style it&#x27;s definately a unique sight. * cons: some may view this as a pro but i found the layout of barcelona too simplified to the point where i didn&#x27;t know where i was staying unless i had google maps handy. most of the city centre is built in a grid like pattern so finding your way around and having points of reference to remember is extremely difficult especially if you aren&#x27;t a local. barcelona was also the first city where i saw/encountered pickpockets, one time a lady began shouting on the metro in spanish accusing a man of trying to pickpocket her, another time i was at a mcdonalds when a man came up to me happily trying to shake my hand while trying to slide his other hand into my pocket (i knew what he was trying to do). lastly, barcelona was hugeeee, i hit 60k steps one day here (bad idea). * favourite memory: partying!!! oh and relaxing in the olympic pool with an incredible view of barcelona and watching sunset over the city from the bunkers! * overall: 9.5/10- **nice, france** (3 nights) * flight from barcelona to nice * hostel: villa saint exupery beach. this hostel was one of the only decently rated hostels available in nice so decided to book it and see how it went. the hostel itself was very boujie, with a hotel like lobby, amazingly decorated with cool hangout areas scattered around and even a gym. that&#x27;s where the luxury ends though, the room was a 14 bed dorm and it was barebones, the beds creaked insanely loudly and were jammed right next to each other, bathrooms didn&#x27;t drain properly and weren&#x27;t cleaned, for being the most expensive hostel of my stay, this was definately a dissapointment. the location was absolutely spectacular i&#x27;d give it that, just a street behind the main square and just a few minutes walk to the beach, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better location. 7.0/10. * pros: nice definately felt like a holiday town so everything felt extremely relaxed and slow paced. people were friendly, spoke english and the overall vibe of the place was amazing. i loved that it was also so close to monaco so we drove down there with some hostel friends and were able to explore that &quot;country&quot; as well. as a car enthusiast, this was an amazing experience. the weather was amazing, the food especially gelato were also incredible. if you want to truly relax and have a proper holiday, i&#x27;d definately recommend visiting nice. * cons: extremelyyyy expensive. a beer was 10 euros, a bottle of water 3 euros for the cheapest. it was hard to enjoy nice since i was keeping track of my spending and i&#x27;d often be over my budget by lunch time. i also felt there wasn&#x27;t much to do in nice, sure there was good dining, day trips to monaco and the beach but other than that i didn&#x27;t feel like it had much to offer. * favourite memory: taking a spontaneous roadtrip to monaco with hostel friends. * overall: 8/10- **cinque terre, italy** (4 nights) * train from nice to cinque terre * hostel: mar-mar. i knew from the moment i saw this on hostelworld the fact that it only had 3 pictures displayed that i was going to be in for a surprise and boy was i right. mario, the owner, greeted me and showed me the hostel, it&#x27;s pretty much an apartment with bunks. one room has got 10 beds with another adjoining room having 4 beds. the hostel also has an amazing balcony terrace with great views of riomaggiore. other than that, the hostel was very basic, simple bunks, two bathrooms and a kitchen, you can&#x27;t complain but it was definately barebones. 6.5/10. * pros: incredible, the pictures you see on google don&#x27;t do this place justice, every town is amazing and the pesto is godtier. if you like hiking you&#x27;ll also love it here, the 5 towns are joined by train as well as hiking trails (closed in some parts) so spending the day hiking and then capping it off with a swim are always amazing. seafood is also amazing here, fried seafood could be had in every town as well as gelato. another thing i really liked was the regular trains that ran between the towns. i booked 4 nights in cinque terre which in hindsight was too much but my reasoning was that i&#x27;d spend a day in each town. in reality, the towns are separated by just a few minute train ride so in theory you could see all towns in a single day.  * cons: not many faults with cinque terre but if i had to name some i&#x27;d say it was very crowded with tourists, other than that it was great. * favourite memory: sleeping on the beach at night, watching the milky way with the occasional shooting stars. * overall: 9/10- **florence, italy** (4 nights) * train from cinque terre to florence * hostel: ostello bello florence. the staff here were super friendly, they gave me free breakfast for my stay even though i didn&#x27;t have it included in my booking and it a pretty solid breakfast too with cold meats, croissant varieties, yogurts and much more. the hostel beds though were triple bunks so being that high up would&#x27;ve been sketchy, lucky for me i always made sure to request a bottom bunk before checking in. the hostel was large with multiple hotels built within the same building complex so finding your way around at first was a bit hard. i met lots of cool people here and they organised trivia night which was fun. they didn&#x27;t do activities like pub crawls so we had to make our own plans for the night. 8.75/10 * pros: florence was amazing, extremely historical and very charming. it felt like there were no new buildings in florence at all and it was unchanged for centuries. seeing the duomo in person was incredible, it was massive, you definately have to visit it in person to appreciate it. the food here was amazing, wild boar seemed like the speciality here so i tried wild boar pasta, as well as many pizzas and sandwiches while here. florence was also a small place so it was very walkable, also note-worthy is the fact that it&#x27;s a great city to do day trips from. while i was here i did a day trip to pisa (found it overrated and quite boring) as well as sienna (amazing). amazing leather markets in florence too as well as museums! * cons: not much bad to say about florence, once again to nitpick i&#x27;d say it was overrun with tourists. no metro was also a bit annoying but by no means a problem.  * favourite memory: seeing a guy with a tattoo of caravaggio&#x27;s medusa take a selfie with the real medusa shield in the uffizi gallery. * overall: 8/10- **rome, italy** (4 nights) * train from florence to rome * hostel: the romehello hostel. the hostel was very big and pretty much a hotel with bunks. i saw families staying here and people weren&#x27;t the most social. i did however manage to meet some cool people and were able to make plans that way for dinner and such. other than that i can&#x27;t really complain, good location near the trevi fountain, all the facilities you could ask for as well as a connected restaurant/bar which was nice. 8.5/10. * pros: the whole of rome feels like you&#x27;re walking through a museum, the cobblestone streets, ancient architecture and incredible food make it an amazing place to just wonder around. i never caught public transport here just because i wanted to see as much of the cool sights by walking amongst them. if you are into history you will for sure love rome and all it has to offer. once again, incredible food here, i cannot count how much pizza and gelato i had in rome, far too much but i walked most of it off. rome had so much to see and do, you could spend months here and still have new things to see or stumble upon.  * cons: rome did feel a bit more expensive than the other places in italy, partly due to the fact that it was incredibly touristy. i&#x27;d also advocate getting up early, around 6am if you hope to get a decent picture with any sights. the trevi fountain during midday was so crowded that there&#x27;s hardly any walking space past it. apart from these minor things, i can&#x27;t fault rome, amazing city.  * favourite memory: pizza, pizza and more pizza. * overall: 8.5/10- **venice, italy** (2 nights) * train from rome to venice * hostel: anda venice. ok now this is actually a hotel with bunks, the place was enormous, 6 floors, a huge working space, multiple kitchens, an outdoor bar with a garden, this place had it all. personally, i find the nicer a hotel appears on the surface the less social it will usually be and for the most part i&#x27;ve been correct. this hostel did have events like karaoke planned so you could socialise but the majority of my interactions were with those in my dorm. the hostel itself was very nice, located not on the main island of venice though so you needed to catch the train to venice itself. 7.5/10 * pros: lives up to the hype. i found venice extremely pretty, the canals and bridges do look the same after a while but you never get tired of them and its always fun to stumble down tiny alleys and discover new sights. i would 100% recommend when in venice intentionally try and get lost, it&#x27;s super cool to just wander around and not know what you&#x27;ll find. additionally, i went to murano and burano. murano wasn&#x27;t my favourite as it didn&#x27;t have much going on when i went (went early morning around 8am) but burano was incredible, super cute and unique. i preferred spending time in burano over venice.  * cons: not much to complain about here either, venice i felt is great for sightseeing and culinary experiences, if i had to fault something it would be that nightlife is pretty non-existent, i would wonder around at 9pm and it seemed like everyone was back at their hotel rooms. * favourite memory: getting lost in the narrow streets and window shopping the amazing blown glass stores. * overall: 8/10.- **milan, italy** (2 nights) * train from venice to milan * hostel: ostello bello. similar to the hostel in florence, this hostel also had great staff, a cool vibe and the dreaded triple bunks. luckily again for me though i was on the bottom bunk so had no worries. located real close to the main train station so was no problem getting around milan. not many organised activities with this hostel so socialising wasn&#x27;t the easiest but if you put yourself out there you would manage just fine. 7/10. * pros: milan definately seemed like a working city compared to the other cities in italy, people were go go go, lots of cars here too so walking around the city wasn&#x27;t the easiest. the duomo cathedral was stunning in person, probably the most impressive building i had seen so far on the trip. once again, amazing food as you would expect anywhere in italy, i recommend a pizza place called &#x27;piz&#x27; which does amazing pizza, they also give free samples while you wait! if you&#x27;re into football you&#x27;ll have fun here since inter milan and ac milan share the stadium so matches happen frequently. * cons: i found milan didn&#x27;t have much to do, i saw the duomo, galleria as well as some museums, other than that i didn&#x27;t see much that caught my eye. perhaps i was just spoilt at this point but i felt like milan was my least favourite of the italian cities i had seen. * favourite memory: watching inter milan vs cremonse in the packed san siro stadium with 70,000 screaming italians. * overall: 7.5/10- **lucerne, switzerland** (1 night) * train from milan to lucerne * hostel: backpackers lucerne. quite a large hostel with lots of families/older people staying here. no social vibe at all, mainly a place for people to relax and recharge. i only met the receptionist here, the dorms were empty when i checked in and with people sleeping when i returned back at night. i was only here for the night so didn&#x27;t put much effort into meeting people. the hostel itself was about a 15 minute walk from the station and was overlooking a nice park. a decent area but not the best. 7/10. * pros: lucerne was absolutely stunning, walking along lake lucerne my jaw dragged on the floor, straight out of a fairytale is how i would describe the landscape here. the air was so crisp, the views in all directions stunning, beauty wise switzerland can&#x27;t be beat. the people all were very friendly and spoke english well, the town was super modern and extremely safe and clean. free busses as well which was nice to get around the city. a small city too so you could definately see most of the sights within a day. * cons: expensive, but then again everyone knows that about switzerland. i wasn&#x27;t in lucerne for long enough to really judge it much but from my limited experience i didn&#x27;t experience anything bad.  * favourite memory: watching the sunset over lake lucerne. * overall: 8/10- **interlaken, switzerland** (2 nights) * train from lucerne to interlaken * hostel: backpackers villa sonnenhof. a cosy hostel with lots of people of all ages staying here. met some solo travellers here but many families and groups were also staying. incredible location in the heart of interlaken, once you walked outside the doors you looked up and saw paragliders flying above you, it was amazing to witness. friendly staff, free towel included and free breakfast, it was a solid hostel. 8/10. * pros: the most beautiful hikes and lakes you will ever experience are in lucerne. the water is such a beautiful light blue colour i&#x27;m amazed how it&#x27;s even possible. the hikes are breathtaking, on mountain tops with incredible views of the valley and lucerne down below. the place is also heaven for adrenaline junkies, anything you want to experience whether it&#x27;s abseiling, mountain climing, paragliding, sky diving you can do it all here.  * cons: no cons to name at all, keep your wallet topped up and put your adventure boots on because it&#x27;s going to be wild. * favourite memory: being caught in a hail storm while doing the harder kulm to augustmatthorn hike and almost dieing, good times. eating fondue after that ordeal. * overall: 8.5/10- **zermatt, switzerland** (2 nights) * train from interlaken to zermatt. * hostel: zermatt youth hostel. this hostel was hard to find, it&#x27;s tucked in the corner of zermatt on the opposite side of the train station. a bit hard to find without navigation but definately easy once you know where it is. it has an amazing view of the matterhorn from the main building which is just incredible. a note to keep in mind is that the hostel is divided into a big and small building, with the smaller building having no view of the matterhorn. i was in a 6 bed dorm here and surprisingly had it all to myself which seemed nice at first but quickly became boring/scary :p. the hostel did an amazing free breakfast with cakes, puddings, cold meats, yogurts etc. which honestly was enough to keep you full for a day of hiking. 8/10. * pros: pictures don&#x27;t do this place justice. zermatt to my surprise was low season in summer so was somewhat empty, a good thing in my eyes though since the temperature was just right, crowds were small and the town felt very relaxed. similar to interlaken, you&#x27;ll love it here if you&#x27;re a fan of hiking, mountaineering or anything mountain biking. the town doesn&#x27;t allow cars but instead has these small electric cars that take you around if you want. most people walk or use mountain bikes to get around. the matterhorn is simply stunning, i spent hours just starting at it every day and watching the first light of sunrise hit it is incredible. * cons: no cons at all. simply stunning, must visit if you are in switzerland. * favourite memory: watching the sunset over the matterhorn. * overall: 9/10- **munich, germany** (4 nights) * train from zermatt to munich * hostel: wombat&#x27;s. quite similar to the wombat&#x27;s in london however this one was not as social i felt, likely just bad luck with the people. the people i met were just in the dorms, most people in the common rooms seemed to be on their laptops or passed out napping. the location is great, near the main train station, it did feel a bit sketchy at night since the street has other hostels on it so there are some rowdy people out at night. the beds were extremely creaky, you were reluctant to move around at night because it would wake up the whole dorm. the wombat&#x27;s hostels i&#x27;ve stayed at have also always had one guy who snored like a chainsaw and this one was no exception. wombat&#x27;s attracts loud snorers, don&#x27;t ask me why. 6.5/10. * pros: munich had pretty gothic buildings and the day trip to neuschwanstein was amazing (even though it was raining). as a car enthusiast, i loved bmw world and bmw welt. the beer gardens were also super cool and the huge beers were a sight to behold. it was amazing seeing the bavarians drink so much beer and somehow still be able to keep it together, apparently getting too drunk is frowned upon there :p. the trip the castle was also incredible, it was raining but the view of the castle was still incredible. very walkable in munich also so there&#x27;s no need to use transport, most of the sights are within close distance of each other. * cons: quite a conservative city from what i experienced. most people didn&#x27;t want to speak english and they loved following rules. i remember walking around at night, coming to cross the road and seeing people waiting at a red light when there was no traffic at all. usually you would jaywalk no problem in europe but in munich they would definately judge you i felt. munich was also quite expensive, considering i had just come from switzerland i couldn&#x27;t fathom paying 20 euros for a schnitzel and pommes.  * favourite memory: beer and schnitzel * overall: 7/10- **vienna, austria** (4 nights) * train from munich to vienna * hostel: jo&amp;joe. ok this was the boujiest hostel i&#x27;ve ever stayed at, it was literally intergrated into an ikea building onto the top floor, the dorm had an incredible view of the city and looked absolutely incredible at night. the bunks were super comfortable, the staff extremely friendly and the decor in the place was all ofcourse ikea supplied :p. i met some cool people here and we explored vienna and did lots of things together. the hostel was right next to the train station which made it really easy to get around. one thing i didn&#x27;t like was that it seemed like a lot of school groups were staying there, meaning a lot of the socialising opportunies were limited to your dorm. the rooftop bar was also accessible by the public which made it hard to know who was a local and who was staying at the hostel. 8.75/10. * pros: incredibly pretty city. vienna felt like the epitome of luxury such an upperclass feeling place (, i loved the cafe culture there, i used to sit in cafes for hours and just devour sacher torte and coffees and no one batted an eye. incredibly friendly people there too with almost everyone speaking english. viennese schnitzel is also incredible and the cafes are amazing. the horse drawn carts around the city are also very charming and add to the classic vibe of the city. * cons: no cons other than that it&#x27;s quite expensive. * favourite memory: being peer pressured into going onto the craziest ride at the prater amusement park. eating sacher torte at demel and cafe sacher.  * overall: 8.5/10- **budapest, hungary** (5 nights) * train from vienna to budapest * hostelone budapest. great location near the ruin bars of budapest, incredibly social hostel with daily activities, pub crawls and an organised boat party which is usually combined with other hostels. i met the most people in this hostel, the place has a great vibe. for a party hostel though, it does lack in luxuries, the bunks were right next to each other and not the sturdiest. the bathrooms on the bottom floor also had no locks, just shower curtains. there were bathrooms upstairs though which was good. the nightly activities really made this feel like an awesome hostel and it definately was. 9/10. * pros: budapest had such an amazing vibe, it was grungy but also super luxurious. szimpla kert was such a cool idea and the bars inside were amazing, a bit unusual but still an extremely unique place. i found the nightlife also had lots to offer and the boat party with unlimted booze for 38 euros was unbeatable. for shopping i also found budapest incredible, so many vintage stores, flea markets and cool stores, i bought way too much stuff here :p. the cafes and food in general here was incredible, all the cafes were incredible and extremely affordable, my favourite was the grumpy food bar cafe where one lady would prepare all meals right in front of you, absolutely amazing food, would recommend to everyone. overall, i&#x27;d say budapest had been the most unique place and one of my favourite cities i&#x27;d been to so far. * cons: the prices of drinks in ruin bars are extortionate. a long island iced tea was 15 euros, daylight robbery for tourists since it&#x27;s such a popular spot. other that that, there&#x27;s no downside to budapest, absolutely amazing city. * favourite memory: budapest boat party with unlimited drinks for 38 euros, need i say more.  * overall: 9.25/10- **krakow, poland** (3 nights) * flight from budapest to krakow * hostel: greg&amp;tom beer house hostel. insane value, at $23 aud a night with free beer, breakfast and dinner, i have no idea how this place makes a profit. it&#x27;s located literally in the heart of krakow, a minute walk and you&#x27;re in the main square. it&#x27;s also got incredible food as it is situated above the actual greg&amp;tom restaurant, guessing that any leftovers are given to the hostel and they&#x27;re amazing. free beer on tap, packaged sandwiches if you are going out, this place was incredible. met so many amazing people here in the dorms and just throughout the hostel. nightly activites and organised trips to the salt mines and auschwitz were also nice to see. i did find the staff a bit cold but still helpful nonetheless. 9.5/10. * pros: amazing value, krakow was super affordable, a nice restaurant meal was less than 10 euros, beers were 1 euro or free in the hostel! krakow was also very small, you could walk around no problems and see all the main sights within a few hours. there was the tram if you needed it and it was reliable and safe. the city didn&#x27;t feel overrun with tourists when i was there which added to the vibe of the place. the jewish quarter in krakow is also amazing and rich with history, i&#x27;d recommend a walking tour through here if you visit. i also had so many of those donuts filled with custards and fillings, omg they were incredible and like 1.5 euro each. krakow i felt had something to offer everyone, amazing food, sights, architecture, people, day trips. amazing city. * cons: weather. krakow was cold, it was about 9 degrees celcius during the day and being an australian i struggled. it was also raining most of the time but it added a super cosy vibe at night. * favourite memory: visiting the krakow shooting range and shooting guns for the first time. * overall: 9/10- **prague, czech republic** (4 nights) * train from krakow to prague * hostel: the roadhouse. incredible hostel, my favourite by far. the hostel is literally an apartment with 20 beds, the moment you walk in you are in the hangout area so instantly meet people. abdul, who worked there was incredibly hospitable and super friendly. he was always down to party at night too which was amazing. the dorms also have little whiteboards next to the beds with the person&#x27;s name written on them so you have no excuses for forgetting people&#x27;s names. the hostel had three bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms, and a kitchen and i even saw a czech grandma working there! there are nightly dinners and beers available, also the nightly pub/club crawls are amazing, you go to great places that locals also go to. such an authentic hostel experience. 10/10. * pros: prague was incredible, it felt like budapest but scaled down and with prettier buildings. the people were incredibly friendly and everyone spoke english, there was also so much to do, every night we went to different bars and clubs and explored all around the city and were able to check out some non-touristy sights too. czech beer is also amazing, although i still quite don&#x27;t understand why they have so much foam in the glass :p, no wonder they drink so much, it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t get much in the glass! overall, prague was super pretty and one of the nicest places i&#x27;d visited, top 3 cities for me. * cons: no cons at all, if i had to nitpick i&#x27;d say it was the excess of tourists. * favourite memory: visiting the planetarium, visiting the dog bar and partying at bike jesus. * overall: 9.5/10**continued in comments**[link to

        <td>a couple years ago i put my career on pause and moved back home to be closer to an ailing parent. i was a data analyst in my previous role, where i mostly worked in excel, power bi, a bit of sql and python. during this pause i beefed up my sql, python and stats knowledge and built some portfolio projects in streamlit to showcase my interests and abilities. i also learned git along the way as well.about a year ago i started job hunting where i was mostly looking for analyst roles. as i progressed in the job hunt i became increasingly interested in analytics engineering but felt like my skills weren&#x27;t quite there yet. at the time i was thinking the best path would be getting another da role and using it to catapult into an engineering role down the line. fast forward a year, countless job applications, numerous interviews later, i finally had the most incredible breakthrough.last week someone in my network connected me to the owner of a software development company that builds ai tools for customers. we exchanged a couple texts, hoped on a call, got talking about my journey in the world of data and how i ultimately want to get into analytics engineering. he then asked me if i was comfortable with window functions in sql (i am) and if i know basic data structures (i do). at that point he asked me if i could send him a copy of my cv and if i could meet with him and some of his teammates for a dinner later in the week. i go to the dinner, meet the teams senior software engineers, we hit it off over some tacos, and they essentially create a role for me out of thin air! it was all very serendipitous and i still have no idea how this happened. they even told me that they weren&#x27;t in the market for hiring but liked my story/journey/tenacity so much that they wanted me to come and work for them. the owner even told me as we were shaking hands and saying goodbye that he doesn&#x27;t care about my background and that &quot;it is all about investing in the right people&quot;.yes, they are a legitimate company and have several large clients that you have heard of. i received their job offer today and i nearly threw up after reading it. the title is data automation developer, so most of my work is going to be in automation testing and they have also thrown in some elt tasks as well. it&#x27;s a fully remote role and one that i never imagined i would have in my career. while i don&#x27;t feel like i am being setup for failure, and i do really like the team, i can&#x27;t help but feel immense imposter syndrome when i look at the job posting that they created and i see all sorts of things i have no experience in. is this even real life?? i understand the idea of hiring on someones potential but this is all incredibly daunting. has anyone had a similar experience to this?</td>

(yeah, quite the kick in the gut)despite this low lsat, i still decided to apply to law school. i was waitlisted at a few schools, but my gpa and previous test score helped me land a scholarship at a decent school. during law school orientation, i took a placement test similar to a practice bar. the test gave the school enough information to make an educated guess on how you would perform on the actual bar. my results showed that i was an ‚Äúat risk‚Äù student and had a high probability of not passing the bar. i was told that only ten other students scored lower than me. due to this, i had to spend the next semester meeting with a fellow who would ensure i was keeping up with my schoolwork. i finished law school in the middle of my class and barely maintained my scholarship status. during our bar prep course, i was reminded by our professor that i was still ‚Äúat risk‚Äù and that i needed to take my bar prep ‚Äúmore seriously.‚Äùafter graduating, i spent the next two months doing bar prep. i hated every second of prep, but i finished the entire program a week early. then, i worked on practice problems for the last week. however, despite my preparation, in the back of my mind, i was terrified because of my previous ‚Äúfailures.‚Äù my life circumstances. the lsat. orientation. bar prep. ‚Äúat risk.‚Äùwell, this week, i found out that i passed the bar with a score high enough to practice in any jurisdiction. those struggling with imposter syndrome in law school, don&#x27;t let your circumstances limit your potential. you&#x27;re not a statistic. you do not have to be a victim of the ‚Äúself-fulfilling prophecy.‚Äùfriend, keep your head up, put your best foot forward, and do not give in to any reason to fail. law school is hard. the bar exam is hard. but in the end, you will become a better person because of it. you&#x27;ve got this.</td>

        <td>hey guys. i just wanted to jump on here to say that i lost my sense of taste and smell the first time i caught covid about two years ago. i tried loads of things to get it back with no results, and in the end all i could do was just wait it out and see what happens. now after two years it‚Äôs finally coming back! i can smell my shampoo again, freshly cut grass, coffee, all those nuances in food that i‚Äôve been missing for 730 days. it‚Äôs honestly felt like a lifetime since i‚Äôve been able to enjoy the simple things in life.i thought i‚Äôd document some of my weird experiences with this and maybe some of you can relate.1) i began being able to smell ‚Äúsomething‚Äù about six months after losing it, however it was only one smell and it was everywhere. it smelled like rotting fruit wafting through the air every time i went outside and was unbearable. that lasted a few months and then more unpleasant smells kept coming back to me. meat, onions, body odour, other peoples breath, basically anything with that sort of scent profile including the inside of my mouth started tasting like burned metal which was completely disgusting. fruit and anything fruit flavoured or scented also began to smell and taste completely rotten.2) my smell would spontaneously get better in stages. it wasn‚Äôt much of a gradual process, more like achievements. it was quite nice actually because i really noticed it every time and it always felt like a little victory to celebrate.3) i caught covid a second time and didn‚Äôt lose my sense of smell. about a year later. i wasn‚Äôt nearly as sick but my smell progress remained intact.4) i caught a normal cold and just before losing my sense of smell with it, it was like my smell turned back on fully again just for a day or so. i don‚Äôt know why but maybe it was because my neurons were really stimulated by the cold virus or something. i lost it and i was devastated because i thought i was back to square one.5) it wasn‚Äôt a linear process. every so often my smell would really improve and then completely disappear again for a day or so and then gradually return to it‚Äôs improved state.this has been a really long and weird journey but it‚Äôs definitely taught me to be more appreciative of what i have.for all you who are still waiting to get it back, don‚Äôt lose hope because even after 2 years it can make a full recovery!</td>

        <td>i just had a complete scare. im still shaking half an hour later.im a solo traveler, female in my mid 20s. i‚Äôve been traveling for almost 3 months now in thailand, vietnam and now indonesia. i meet friends in all the cities i go to but half the time im traveling from place to place alone. i‚Äôve been in indonesia for 2 weeks already and today ive spent 10 hours traveling from one island to the next. i was in a 30 minute grab with a man, the last part of my travel day before getting to my hostel. it was night time, close to midnight. he was immediately quite friendly, asking me what i plan on doing in this city. normal chit chat in a taxi. then he starts asking me personal questions that rarely i get. how old are you, are you traveling alone, are you meeting friends at the hostel, do you have a boyfriend, ‚Äúi want you to come sit in the front seat next to me‚Äù. i told him no and he proceeds to ask for my instagram. i told him no. then he ‚Äúrates the drive‚Äù even though we had 15 minutes left. this effectively completed the drive on my end. i could no longer see the route or use any of the help features on the app. this is when i started to panic.i told him to pull over and said i needed to get out of the car. he asked why and i said i was going to throw up. i tried faking that i was gagging. he seemed hesitant and confused at first but eventually pulled over. i get out of the car and quickly grab my bags from the trunk and he gets upset. he said ‚Äúwhat are you doing? no! come back‚Äù and i told him he was creepy and i‚Äôm getting a new ride. there were two other men nearby outside a closed warung, one holding a small child, and i guess the fact that they had a toddler felt safe to me so i walked to them. he pulled his car around and walked over to us all. he starts talking in indonesian to them and the other men laugh and smirk. he‚Äôs trying to convince me to get back in the car. he‚Äôs apologizing, asking what he did wrong, pleading me to let him take me to my destination. he swore that the reason he completed the drive early was so he could accept a new passenger. for 5 minutes he tries to plead with me, telling me he‚Äôs not a criminal and he‚Äôs sorry and to get back in the car. the other men are still laughing occasionally and talking with him in indonesian throughout our conversation. i felt like a fool. my whole body was shaking.he wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. i felt trapped and felt like no one cared how i felt and i felt belittled because i knew they were all making fun of me in their language. i got back in his car and we didn‚Äôt talk the rest of the ride. he dropped me off at my hostel but then he came inside and started talking to the ladies at reception, in indonesian. 1 girl continued to check me in, and 2 other girls stepped away from the desk listening to him. they were talking for at least 5 minutes, the whole time i was getting checked in. i knew they were talking about me and he was telling them what happened in the car, even though the one girl checking me in said ‚Äúno, he‚Äôs not talking about you.‚Äù while the one girl walked me to my dorm i told her what happened and she just says ‚Äúoh‚Äù in an acknowledging way and then proceeded with the hostel rules and details. i felt so dismissed. she left and i started crying.i have not once felt unsafe my entire time solo traveling until tonight. i‚Äôve been hit on, i‚Äôve had locals call after me and follow me as i walk by trying to get my instagram or take photos of me. i‚Äôve had guys and taxi drivers ask me a few of those same questions but they always knew when to stop and i never felt like it was anything other than playful or curiosity. but with my grab driver tonight i really just felt it was different. all the alarm bells were going off in my head. my friend was raped (not in this country, but a country that is considered very safe for female backpackers) by a local while solo traveling. back in my home country, all of the women closest to me have been sexually assaulted. i have been sexually assaulted. 5 of my close friends have been raped. i know cultures are different. but i do not consider myself to be some naive tourist who takes everything personally and is dramatic. i‚Äôve had men in these countries do creepy stuff that would never fly in my home country - but i know most of it is innocent and harmless. but tonight felt so different down to my core.i feel so belittled, demeaned, dismissed. i feel like i completely misread a situation yet my whole body was telling me to jump out of that car and get away from that man. and i would at least think the lady at the hostel would show concern but even she blew me off it seems. my legs were shaking so hard i couldn‚Äôt even walk well. i just had to get this off my chest. update - the ladies at my hostel just messaged me and apologized for what happened in the car. they said they were trying not to show concern because that man was talking angrily with the 2 other ladies who worked at the hostel, and was raising his voice at them. they told me his behavior was inappropriate and illegal as a grab driver and to rate him 1 star. i‚Äôm honestly scared to because of retaliation - he knows i am staying at this hostel for a few days.</td>

stunning nature, tasty food, incredible history, cheap, and home to some of the best cities in europe.**slovenia**-	slovenia‚Äôs beauty as a country is hard to top. medieval villages, giant caves, beautiful lakes, cool castles, etc. plus, ljubljana is also one the coolest cities in europe.**ireland**-	between the craic of the people and the raw beauty, the island of ireland is a must-visit destination. just get out of dublin as soon as you can.**italy**-	italy lives up to the hype. the food is great, the countryside is charming, and the people exhibit solid hospitality.**croatia**-	croatia truly has something for everyone**favorite peoples:****dutch**-	the dutch have perfected the art of being direct and genuine, it‚Äôs honestly beautiful. i found the dutch to be a progressive people that showed true hospitality and care for others. i met a ton of dutch people along my travels and i enjoyed the company of every single one both in and outside of the netherlands. it helps that they have an awesome accent.**irish**-	a hearty bunch. the irish are a fun lot and they exhibit a tendency to self-regulate themselves even when they are having fun. if you need help, the irish would always lend a hand or find someone who could help you. it was difficult to recall an irish person i didn‚Äôt enjoy. **serbians**-	a tough but good people. throughout my travels, especially as an american, i was warned that the serbians would show me nothing but disdain. this was completely false in my experience, granted i didn‚Äôt go around advertising that i was an american. the serbians didn‚Äôt have time for bullshit but they were genuine people willing to help. it‚Äôs a fact that almost every vehicle stopped for me when i was hitchhiking in serbia, even in ireland this didn‚Äôt happen.**polish**-	a solid people that really looked out for me. the poles showed me great hospitality and steered me in the right direction multiple times when i was about to make a mistake. i consistently found that the poles hid incredible warmth under tough exteriors.**italians**-	italians were fun. after many countries where i didn‚Äôt see a smile for weeks, the italian temperament brought back warmth to me. italians outside of tourist areas showed incredible hospitality and i miss walking into a caf√© and immediately being greeted with a ‚Äúciao!‚Äù**favorite cities:****barcelona, spain**-	barcelona has everything i want from a city; beaches, beautiful hills with inspiring views, great food from around the world, efficient public transport, endless attractions, incredible bars/clubs, and great people. shout out to the catalonians!**prague, czech republic**-	easily one of, if not the most, beautiful city in europe. prague was one of the destinations that exceeded the hype surrounding it. the food was incredible, the beer was great, the architecture was breathtaking, the parks were clean, and the city was a ton of fun if you like to party. my only critique is how crowded the city can get; i personally would not visit prague in the high season. **ljubljana, slovenia**-	the coolest alternative city in europe. not only is the city surrounded by beautiful hills and a historic castle, ljubljana functions as the perfect jump-off spot to see the most wonderful sights slovenia has to offer. ljubljana was a funky city with a unique soul. this city is expanding rapidly and the best time to visit this city is probably now.**gdansk, poland**-	the true hidden gem of europe. located right on the baltic sea, gdansk is a little city with fantastic restaurants/bars and incredible architecture. this small city played a surprisingly large role at the beginning of ww2 and the end of the cold war and it‚Äôs home to some impressive museums. sit on the canal, eat some perogies, and marvel at this unique destination.**krakow, poland**-	it‚Äôs hard to visit krakow without being impressed with some aspect of the city. the market square in the city center is massive with incredible architecture and cool traditions. the city offers plenty to the party-goer and there‚Äôs great food and drink. this city had a vibrant feel about it.**ghent, belgium**-	downtown ghent is simply breathtaking, especially at night. ghent is often described as looking like hogwarts and it really felt as if a dragon should be perched atop some of the roofs. the canals were cool, the bars were unique, and the whole city had a funky alternative feel. i really enjoyed my time in ghent.**zagreb, croatia**-	i left zagreb feeling as if it was the most livable city in europe. it was clean, spacious, friendly and fun without being overwhelming. the city had a refreshing vibe about it that i really enjoyed.**venice, italy**-	venice is world-renowned for a reason, there‚Äôs nowhere quite like it. venice is like an adult playground; the small bridges and alleyways seem endless and you never know what amazing view you‚Äôll discover at the end of each avenue. like prague, i personally would not visit venice during the high season. both of these cities (prague &amp; venice) are not designed for large crowds.**osijek, croatia**-	osijek is another hidden gem of europe. this city was exceptionally clean and had fantastic open spaces for recreation. although this city can get a bit sleepy in the winter, osijek shines in the summer months with great restaurants that sit along the drava that flows alongside the city. **least favorite cities:****belgrade, serbia**-	i found belgrade to be incredibly depressing. even when i was trying to see this city in a positive light, there wasn‚Äôt much i enjoyed about it. belgrade is largely considered the ‚Äúparty capital of eastern europe‚Äù but i think those days are long past. the clubs/bars were kind of plain and really sketchy. the serbian military museum was cool though.**bratislava, slovakia**-	much like belgrade, bratislava had a really depressing and gloomy feel to it. it lacked any distinct identity and seemed to be coughing the last dying breaths of its ‚Äúeurotrip‚Äù appeal.**berlin, germany**-	i found berlin to be the extreme opposite of how it was advertised to be. at one time berlin may have been a city where one could be whomever you wanted to be, now berlin seemed to have a distinct mold one was expected to conform to. i felt self-conscious as soon as i stepped off the train. it saddened me seeing travelers contort themselves in hopes of being accepted into whatever techno club was most exclusive. i know because i did it too. my feelings toward berlin can be perfectly summed up in an interaction i had with a berlin resident. i asked them how i looked before entering a club and they suggested i color over the white soles of my shoes with black sharpie. berlin is a huge international city, however. there are admirable aspects of this city such as incredible food. **madrid, spain**-	there was nothing distinct about madrid to me. madrid just felt like any other big city. practice your spanish if you intend to visit madrid, you‚Äôll need it. **favorite hostels:****best overall:****home hostel, lisbon**-	far and above the best hostel i experienced in europe. cozy, clean, welcoming, impressive breakfast/dinner, great location, and the staff fostered a great sense of community.**hostel uppelink, ghent**-	the coziest hostel i visited in europe. it was clean with great facilities and an awesome communal area. oh! it was also located in the coolest location with direct views over downtown ghent. **passenger hostel, porto**-	great location, great facilities, great breakfast, and great fun.**anda hostel, venice**-	like no hostel i had ever experienced before or after. this hostel was like a little city in and of itself. the hostel had its own restaurant, bar, and tons of fun communal areas. the hostel hosted large-scale nightly events that were a lot of fun and it was very easy to meet people.**swanky mint, zagreb**-	i loved swanky mint! this hostel had the best full-functioning bar of any hostel in europe and the cozy little kitchen brought everyone together. it was super easy to meet other travelers here.**eastseven hostel, berlin**-	this hostel fostered an awesome sense of community. it was clean and i desperately wished i had spent my full time in berlin at this hostel.**il nosadillo hostel, bologna**-	a clean, cozy little hostel. the centralized communal area functioned as a great place to meet other travelers. **best party hostels:****madhouse, prague**-	hands down the best party hostel in europe. it had all of the positive aspects of a good party hostel without the douchey/toxic elements that come with other party hostels. awesome staff that went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and having fun. just go in expecting to get drunk and have a wild time.**hostel one paralelo, barcelona**-	barcelona is a party city and hostel one paralelo helps you flow into the party scene of barcelona seamlessly. this hostel hosts events every day with its sister hostels and provides guests with ample opportunities to meet other travelers. the staff were awesome.**carpe noctem, budapest**-	this hostel was intimate and fun. the staff know all the best ruin bars to take you to and the cozy nature of this hostel forces you to get to know the other guests really well. **least favorite hostels:****wild elephants, bratislava**-	just thinking back to this hostel makes me slightly uncomfortable. i would not recommend this hostel to anyone, there are much better party hostels in europe to visit. this hostel has a reputation among party hostels because, well, almost anything goes. however, this didn‚Äôt lead to a fun party environment. when i was there it had an extremely douchey vibe and i honestly felt bad for the few women who were there (mostly volunteers) because they were being hit on incessantly. one night i counted the hostel pub crawl and it was 18:1 men to women. the whole hostel felt and smelled cold, damp, and musty. i genuinely wanted to disinfect my entire body after staying there and not surprisingly i got really sick after leaving. i met some cool staff members but i otherwise have nothing positive to say about this hostel. it was nasty and not in a good way.**sunflower hostel, berlin**-	this hostel attracted a lot of young partygoers hoping to get into the club, berghain since it‚Äôs right down the street. however, it was really gloomy and it wasn‚Äôt social in the slightest. the key system was senselessly archaic and the staff didn‚Äôt seem to care about anything. it seemed that the best years of this hostel were behind it. stay at eastseven. **attractions/sites worth visiting:**-	the tatra mountains, poland-	all of slovenia-	western ireland-	oktoberfest, munich-	the gyermekvas√∫t (kid‚Äôs train), budapest-	the museum of broken relationships, zagreb-	the bunkers, barcelona-	majdanek concentration camp (all concentration camps), poland-	sintra, portugal-	prague in the low season-	venice in the low season **overrated attractions/sites:**-	bran castle (dracula‚Äôs castle), romania-	the temple bar, dublin-	prague during peak season-	venice during peak season**what i appreciated about europe:****public transportation infrastructure and the lack of stigma.**-	i was so envious of europe‚Äôs public transportation system. not only is the us lacking the appropriate infrastructure but we also have an unfortunate stigma associated with using public transport. **the diversity in cultures, languages, and history within a small scale of space.**-	europeans can access totally different cultures within a distance comparable to driving to a new state in the us. this certainly broadens the average european‚Äôs perspective and provides a greater awareness of other cultures. **more affordable higher education.**-	america is handicapping its youth by anchoring young professionals with decades (or generations) of educational debt. **a greater consciousness of clothing aesthetic and fashion.**-	americans love our athletic-leisure. europeans simply wear better fitting clothes.  **walking. europeans walk much more than americans.****what i missed about the states:****american hospitality and service.**-	i craved the hospitality and efficiency of american service by the end of my travels. if you know, you know. **casual friendliness toward strangers. smiling!**-	americans are loud, sometimes arrogant, and many times ignorant but we‚Äôre usually very friendly, especially to strangers. i missed being smiled at. **the lack of cigarette culture.**-	europeans need to put down the cigarettes the way americans need to put down the burgers. **free usage of public toilets and free water.**-	i nearly peed my pants too many times searching for local currency to give to a bathroom attendant. **takeaways/personal growths:**- when you‚Äôre alone in a foreign place it may feel as if you‚Äôre treading in unfamiliar water that is occupied by people that seem to know exactly what they‚Äôre doing and where they‚Äôre going. this feeling forces you to look back at yourself and find solace within. i now believe solo travel is the best way to foster a deep love for yourself.- the only validation i now need is self-validation. naturally i want to be liked by others but i no longer need to be. i have done the work, i have proven myself to myself.- you will learn how resilient you are. you will deal with rejection in some form at least once during your travels. you may ask for help and be ignored, you may try to speak a foreign language and be laughed at, you may spark up a conversation without success, and you may approach someone romantically and feelings aren‚Äôt reciprocated. if you‚Äôre lucky, all of these scenarios will happen to you. all of them happened to me. in almost every way it&#x27;s better to step out of your comfort zone and fail than to remain safe and harbor regret. avoid this at all costs. get rejected.- you will not return home the same. you should not return home the same.- solo travel is worth every cent you spend. ‚Äúbuy the ticket, take the ride.‚Äù</td>

        <td>i read a post a few weeks back about a young man who was in thailand i think. was his last few days there before going home and befriended a group of friendly people, was a woman and 2 or 3 men i think, they said they were from somewhere in europe, he said he was leaving back home tomorrow and today was his last day. then at some point they were all outside together and these guys jumped him and took all he had on him. i&#x27;m not victim blaming in anyway at all and it sucks what happened to him. i&#x27;m just making this post for people that are new to leaving their home country. you&#x27;re safer coming off looking broke. obviously this still could have happened to him, i&#x27;m just saying if you come off as a poor and broke backpacker the probability of you being a target is potentially in some cases and circumstances lower. strangers i meet, fucking hell even family in some cases i don&#x27;t want them to know about my financial situation so i don&#x27;t tell them. i&#x27;ve been to quite a few places, anyone that is for some reason particularly interested in me or speaking to me in a setting like a bar for example, i lead them to believe i&#x27;m broke. i lost all my money at the casino, i spent all my money on going to a destination wedding thats why i&#x27;m here, i make shit up, but anything for a potential organized scammer to conclude that i&#x27;m not worth the trouble, that i&#x27;m a poor target that won&#x27;t yield anything worth jumping me or trying to get one over on me. i wear a walmart casio watch(the days i remember to put it on) generic brands of clothes, nothing name brand, drinking national beer.all these details though are something thieves look for, they are assessing who is worth the time and trouble. creating a probability of who will likely have something. the compulsive gambler with no money that just sold his family heirloom at a pawnshop and still lost probably isn&#x27;t an ideal target. the guy on 2 week paid holiday that leaves tomorrow or in the next few days that explained his itinerary and clearly has a job that he or she can afford a round trip ticket they must be wealthy or atleast worth ripping off. he or she may have some money on them in cash, plus cards with a positive balance. just is a bit of solotravel things i learned that i noticed help, thats all i&#x27;m saying and just putting it out there that it might help. a few words can be the difference between someone thinking you&#x27;re worth it or not. things get awkward when the guy or couple in the party hostel start asking you for help with stuff and they&#x27;ll pay you back when their embassy mails them their credit cards.i sent my brother money once years ago and he has this idea that i&#x27;m some kind of atm.  or you can pull the uno reverse card and ask them for money.edit: about half of the people reading this are misinterpreting what i&#x27;m saying. i&#x27;m not saying that you should or that i live in fear or paranoia. if i did i wouldn&#x27;t have a passport and i would have never left my hometown. im only say sometimes depending on the context of the situation and circumstances and to maintain social norms or etiquette, a little white lie that gets the message across you may not be the best candidate for a robbery might be all it takes for them to take the target off your back. or even people asking you for money, if i had a friend that got too comfortable asking me for money instead of saying the word no and them getting mad or hurt or pissed off or drama ensuing i would just rather them think that i&#x27;m broke so they stop asking.</td>

        <td>so i‚Äôm not sure what the general opinion is here on psychedelics, i assume a handful have done them and most haven‚Äôt but that doesn‚Äôt matter. psychedelics have been shown to incur a feeling of an expansion of consciousness or the mind, which i think is a perfectly apt metaphor for solo travel.in my experiences, when i travel solo, i‚Äôm usually thrown into experiences i would never otherwise imagine myself being in. similar to a ‚Äòtrip‚Äô, if i resist and keep trying to make things ‚Äòperfect‚Äô, i have a miserable time. but if i go with the flow, however, i‚Äôm usually rewarded with a wonderful memory, a feeling of pure bliss and freedom. i‚Äôve learned that in most situations, things turn out fine in the end as long as i trust in the universe and in my self.also, travel has definitely made me expand my mind in more ways than one. one of my favourite ‚Äòside effects‚Äô of solo travel is that it actually strengthened my relationships with people back at home. even when i was travelling a bunch and i didn‚Äôt see them often, i had a newfound appreciation of them.before i ventured on journeys, my whole world was limited to my immediate circle. we are all quite alike but i chose instead to focus on our differences, leading me to be annoyed by the choices some of my friends and family make.however, when i travelled i met people from all over the world, who come from such vastly different backgrounds, who may not even speak the same language - and *yet* i managed to find common ground, and to relate to them with our shared humanity.this perspective shift from ‚Äòwe are different‚Äô with my group of friends to ‚Äòwe are all more alike than we believe‚Äô helped me to be a more empathic and understanding human being.anyway just thought of this on the bus ride home and wanted to share. in 4 days i‚Äôm going on a short 2 and a half week trip, my first in almost 3 years, and i can‚Äôt wait! much love everyone :)</td>

        <td>i recently got back from my three-week solo trip to europe, visiting three countries with a different type of accommodation in each (dorm hostel, pod hostel and hotel).
i went back and forth about whether i should do the trip or not, i delayed it once and spoke to many people to help decide if it was a good idea for me or not, as someone who is quite socially anxious and has never travelled alone before. i was very worried i was going to get over there and be miserable, wasting my money and then feeling worse about myself.but i did it. 
the idea behind the trip was to:* put myself in social situations.* be in situations that would force me to adapt without leaning on anyone else.* learn to be content by myself in public.* do all the fun things in each of the locations that interested me.happy to report i did all of these!i will not pretend there were times i was lonely. the first day was especially tough. staying connected with my family and friends back home helped a lot - as well as practicing mindfulness, meditation, and journaling. there were also many times where people struck up a conversation with me (e.g., waiting in lines, in hostel rooms) and i reciprocated.what was important (to me):* having a daily itinerary planned before i left, with things i wanted to do booked ahead.   * include group activities - walking tours were great.* staying in hostels, 4-6 seems ideal as you will talk to others in the room.   * i was not a fan of the pod hostel, and i would not do it again. maybe a hotel in the middle to break it up and get some down time.* set achievable goals.   * i had some such as: ask a traveller to take a photo of me, initiate a conversation with a fellow traveller, ask a local for directions, learn the metro system.* spending time in nature (e.g., hiking, parks) and reflecting by oneself.* keep the luggage light, one bag.overall, i feel better than before i left. i am proud of myself for taking this journey and still enjoying it. did i experience moments of loneliness? yes. did i face anxiety? absolutely. i was (and am) still shy - my personality did not do a 180. but i worked through my emotions and realised i am capable of more than i thought. 
  
  if there is anyone in my position slightly considering this, i highly recommend it. i almost did not do it, but i am glad i did.</td>

The first chart doesn't really reveal anything beyond the obvious, so I decided to dig a little deeper by exploring the frequent tri-grams that occur in the dataset for the lawschool subreddit. I was immediately surprised to see the top 3 to be mirror reflections of one another. I'm not a law student so I don't really know why those 3 words are mentioned as a group often, but I'm curious to hear why. The rest of the tri-grams in the top 10 are pretty self-explanatory.

```python
#Topic Modelling

from sklearn.decomposition import NMF, LatentDirichletAllocation

count_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
term_frequency = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(lawschool_list)
feature_names = count_vectorizer.get_feature_names()

print(f"Shape of term freq matrix = {term_frequency.shape}")
print(f"Num of features identified = {len(feature_names)}")

#LDA model with 5 topics
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=5, random_state=0)  
lda.fit(term_frequency)  

def display_topics(model, feature_names, no_top_words):
    for topic_idx, term_weights in enumerate(model.components_):
        
        sorted_indx = term_weights.argsort()

        topk_words = [feature_names[i] for i in sorted_indx[-no_top_words :]]
        print(f"Topic {topic_idx}:", end=None)
        print(";".join(topk_words))


display_topics(lda, feature_names, 10)
```

    Shape of term freq matrix = (100, 2340)
    Num of features identified = 2340
    Topic 0:

TFIDF Vectorizer seemed to detect more distinct topic selections in the lawschool subreddit. I can easily infer Topic 1 to be about exam preparation like the bar and all the difficult long hours studying for it. Topic 3 sounds like users are posting submissions related to being a student and maybe words of support or encouragement. Topic 4 can easily be described as discussion topics related to working at a firm over the summer or a job offer of sorts.

```python
# Lawschool Sentiment Over Time
lawschool['published'] = pd.to_datetime(lawschool['published'])

lawschool_monthly = lawschool.copy()
lawschool_monthly.set_index('published', inplace=True)
lawschool_monthly = lawschool_monthly.resample('W').agg({'neg': 'mean', 'neu': 'mean', 'pos': 'mean', 'compound': 'mean'})
```


```python
# Plot the sentiment scores over time
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 5))
sns.lineplot(x=lawschool_monthly.index, y=lawschool_monthly['neg'], label='Negative', linewidth=4)
sns.lineplot(x=lawschool_monthly.index, y=lawschool_monthly['neu'], label='Neutral', linewidth=4)
sns.lineplot(x=lawschool_monthly.index, y=lawschool_monthly['pos'], label='Positive', linewidth=4)

plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

For visualizing sentiment over time, I chose to use the line chart for interpretability. The most significant portion of the time-series is the month of march, especially at the beginning, where a substantial collection of negatively sentimented posts were submitted. Could it be the period before bar exams? ü§î

## Task 9: Write a summary of your findings!

## Write your summary in this cell
## --------------------------------


--Distribution Plots--
Looking at the distribution of compound sentiments, we see immediately how balanced (or skewed) our datasets are according to their shape. I was a little disappointed to see so many positively-scored posts in the r/solotravel dataset. I was hoping to see a slight more mix of positives and negatives. This goes the same for the r/dataengineering subreddit


--{solotravel} sentiment analysis by location--
it was interesting to see which geographic areas mentioned ranked the most/least by users in the solotravel subreddit based on their compound score. i made sure to set the minumum post count threshold to 5 to ensure that there is sufficient sample for a somewhat general consensus. it is not fair to have 1 negative review of a country/place represent the whole country in this analysis if there was only 1 post about said country! it was also interesting to see the bias that the subreddit seemingly had towards european travel destinations as opposed to non-european travel destinations, namely asia. 
i examined this disparity close and expanded it to representing the range of values via boxplots - building off the absolute average scores. what we see then is geographic locations who have strong vs weak consensus (pos, neg, neu, and compound) based on the box length. for example, from the boxplots, we can confirm that the european cities of Berlin, Venice, and Madrid are squarely considered among users in the subreddit to be associated with a positive experience.



---{data engingeer} sentiments by topic buckets---
similar to what was done for solotravel dataset, i grouped up the contents of each individual post into selected topics. from there, we can see how posts relating to or talking about said selected topics are generally ranked based on sentimental polarity scores. for the most part, posts relating to "projects", "career", and "company" are fairly positive. an interesting point about the "people" topic bucket is that while it is positive on average, it has a longer body than the rest, which means there are also mixed sentiments. is this representative of the actual data? i don't think so because "people" is a very general term and it can mean many different things based on context. so without context, i would argue that it is not conveying much as opposed to the other topic buckets.

then, i decided to do the same for data tools topics. it was really cool to see that Snowflake is the most well-received out of the bunch when people mentioned it in their posts - judging by the median from the compound boxplot. conversely, apache appears to be less than well-received but still relatively positive. databricks on the other hand is fairly positive but runs into the familiar problem of having a lot of mixed reviews to it.



---{covid19} top bri-grams over time---
for the covid19 subreddit, i knew i wanted to see time being an important element in my analysis. so i conducted a time-series plot, using week's rather than months, to analyze the shift in bi-gram frequencies or mentions over time. from the scatter plot, we can see that covid-related bigrams are showing up in recent weeks - the right side of the plot around where we are in the year (october 2023). but i wouldn't be alarmed as these are mere bi-grams and not covid tests themselves which means this is just an indicator of how many times covid-related discussion is being brought up. what's also interesting about this scatterplot is the seeming gap in discussion around week 20 mark - which around march and april of last year. so around spring time of last year, there was a gap of covid-related discussion among users and submissions alike in the covid19 subreddit - interesting!


--{two sentence horror}-- 
for this rather niche subreddit, i wanted to see the story length distribution of the dataset, and where the majority of posts landed. it was surprising to see a normal distribution based on the histogram plots i created - at least for the total count.  i realize the histograms are also correctly pointing out outliers in the data, so removing those would certainly grant us a definitive normal distribution around the center (40 word length).



all in all, i think this was a fantastic project to perform light NLP and text analysis given the time constraint. i feel like i have only just scratched the surface with my insights. thank you for reading.
